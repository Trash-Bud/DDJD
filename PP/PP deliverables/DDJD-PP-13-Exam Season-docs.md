# Exam Season

Stressful times are upon us. FEUP students, ravaged by mountains of content to study and deadlines without end, inhabit the walls of their faculty. It is up to you to help them pull through (and maybe also grab a tuna mayo baguette at the cafeteria).

## Manual

### Goal of the game

Survive the waves of students and collect money to reach the highest score!

### Controls

*   Movement is performed with **WASD or Arrow** keys
*   "Attack" using the **RMB**
*   Aim with your **Mouse**
*   Swap between the 2 worktools with the **Scroll Wheel**

### Worktools

For the worktools at your disposal, you have the **Research Paper** and the **Coffee Cup**.

The Research Paper functions like a melee weapon, swinging and swatting enemies, knocking them back and dealing damage at a short range.

The Coffee Cup shoots coffee balls in the direction you're aiming, for a longer range but less impactful hit.

### Students

Throughout your journey through the B hall, you will encounter different types of students.

**You** - do I need to say anything else?

**Sleepyheads** - these sluggish students never got their morning coffee and just want a cup of your brew. They wander around, hunting for a fix. And nothing stands between a student and their coffee.

**Researchers** - who said dissertations were all fun and games? Writing and rewriting and rewriting is not only frustrating, but very wasteful of paper sheets. These students like to keep their distance to focus on their tasks, but throw their drafts all over the faculty halls.

### Powerups

Aside from money, students seldom drop powerups that will aid you in your quest for baguettes.

The **PC Charger** will energize you, speeding up your movement to close that precious gap between you and those pesky Researchers.

The **Meta Analysis on Core and Arm Strength** will give you a breakthrough on how to swing that Research Paper much harder.

The **Stevia Packet** will make your coffee pack a bigger punch, with no artificial sweeteners but all of the flavor™.

### Tips

Take the first few encounters as an opportunity to get familiar with the controls and gameplay. It **will** get more difficult over time!

If you get hit, don't panic! You'll have a grace period of invincibility afterwards which can get you out of rough situations.

Try not to get cornered, and use the Research Paper to carve a safe path through the horde.

Make use of the powerups while you have them! Mobility and DPS are very valuable.

Watch out for those paper balls! They can sneak up on you when you're not paying attention.

## Development Process Highlights

We went through various iterations of the code structure as we evolved in our experience with: Godot features and best practices; game programming patterns and coding for future extension; difficulties and solutions for development struggles.

A lot of time was invested designing and solidifying visual communication: color palette, silhouettes, theming and visual clarity.

Usage of Godot Nodes and Scenes allowed and will allow for generalization and recycling of game elements.

We developed the features following a sensible order of priorities - core features, then visuals, then add-ons and game feel/quality of life tweaks.
